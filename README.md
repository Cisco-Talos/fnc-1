# Fake News Challenge - Team SOLAT IN THE SWEN

In the below directories, you can find code used by Team SOLAT IN THE SWEN to perform stance detection on a number of news headlines and article text. Our model is based on an weighted average between a deep convolutional neural network and a gradient-boosted decision trees. Both `tree_model` and `deep_learning_model` contain their own `README.md` files detailing their model and providing instructions for running and installation. The model averaging process in described in `tree_model`

For those interested, `tree_model/README.md` has detailed information on how to run our models to duplicate our results.

**Primary Authors:**     Doug Sibley (dosibley@cisco.com), Yuxi Pan (yuxpan@cisco.com)

**Primary Organizer:**  Sean Baird (seanrichardbaird@gmail.com)
